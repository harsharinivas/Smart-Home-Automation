Smart home automation system for over the internet control of electrical appliances through a web based dashboard or mobile app.

The project uses an open source platform, thinger.io to make API calls to control the devices over the internet.
The hardware code is designed for a NodeMCU 1.0 and has been succesfully tested on the same.

You need to setup a thinger server first, see thinger.io for more help.
Next upload the hardware code into the devices.
Setup a database server for the dashboard.
Upload the dashboard files on a XAMP server.
Once everything is uploaded and linked properly, the dashboard will be able to control any connected device!
